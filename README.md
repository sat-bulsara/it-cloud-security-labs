# 🌩️ IT → Cloud → Cloud Security Labs

## Purpose

This repository documents my **hands-on progression from networking foundations to cloud and cloud security engineering**.

It is not a collection of random labs.

Each lab is:
- Built deliberately
- Broken intentionally
- Fixed methodically
- Documented with security thinking

The goal is to demonstrate **real-world engineering mindset**, not exam memorisation.

---

## What This Repo Shows

- Strong **networking fundamentals** (DNS, routing, traffic flow)
- **Linux-first** operational skills
- Cloud-native thinking (Azure-focused)
- Security mindset:
  - Least privilege
  - Attack surface awareness
  - Failure and misconfiguration analysis
- Clear progression from **infrastructure → cloud → security**

Recruiters should be able to answer:
> “Can this person reason about systems when things go wrong?”

by reading this repo.

## How the Labs Are Structured

Each lab follows the same structure:

- **Goal** — what the lab is proving
- **Architecture / Setup**
- **Steps performed**
- **What Broke** ✅
- **How It Was Fixed**
- **Security Considerations**
  - Attack surface
  - Misconfiguration risk
  - Least privilege decisions
- **Lessons Learned**

Failure analysis is intentional and documented.

## Lab Progression (High Level)

1. **Linux & Networking Foundations**
   - Server hardening
   - IP, DNS, routing
   - Users, permissions, services

2. **Network Services & Failure Analysis**
   - DNS architecture and outages
   - DHCP behaviour
   - Logging and incident diagnosis

3. **Security Controls**
   - Firewalls
   - Segmentation
   - Authentication and auditing

4. **Cloud Transition**
   - Azure networking
   - Cloud DNS
   - Hybrid thinking

5. **Cloud Security**
   - IAM & RBAC
   - Secure architectures
   - Logging, monitoring, detection

Each lab builds on the previous one.

## Tooling & Environment

- **OS:** Ubuntu Server, Windows Server (where relevant)
- **Cloud:** Microsoft Azure
- **Virtualisation:** Parallels / UTM (macOS)
- **Documentation:** Markdown, diagrams, screenshots
- **Mindset:** Build → Break → Fix → Explain

---

## Why This Exists

I am intentionally building toward:
- Cloud Engineer
- Cloud Security Engineer
- Long-term: Security-focused Cloud Architect

This repo is designed to show:
- Depth, not shortcuts
- Judgment, not just tools
- Growth over time

## How to Use This Repo

- Start with `/labs`
- Read labs in order
- Pay attention to **What Broke** and **Security Considerations**
- Diagrams are in `/diagrams`

> Networking is the foundation of cloud.  
> Security is the discipline of controlling it.  
> This repo shows how I’m learning both.
